This is Autotalent, a pitch correction plugin for LADSPA.

To compile, type make.
To install (in /usr/lib64/ladspa/), type make install.

Keep in mind that you may need to change the install directory
in the Makefile.

Also note that you'll need to have LADSPA installed, in addition
to the LADSPA devel packages.
